## Project Overview

This research explores the neurological basis of gender stereotypes using **Electroencephalography (EEG)** in a **Lexical Decision Task (LDT)**. It examines the event-related potentials (ERPs) **N400** and **P600**, which are linked to semantic and syntactic processing, respectively. The aim was to assess whether incongruent gender-stereotyped word pairs elicit measurable neural responses.

## Key Components

- **Keywords**: EEG, lexical decision task, gendered stereotype activation, N400, P600
- **Research Question**: Can EEG responses during a lexical decision task reveal the presence of gender stereotypes in language?

## Methodology

- **Experimental Design**: Participants were exposed to prime-target word pairs categorized as congruent, incongruent, neutral, or non-words. EEG data and reaction times were recorded during the task.
- **Stimuli**: Gendered words scored on a masculinity-femininity scale were sourced from Roberts & Utych (2020). Non-words were generated using ChatGPT.
- **EEG Data Collection**: EEG signals were recorded using an ActiCap system and preprocessed using Python's MNE package.
- **Analysis**: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were analyzed to identify differences in reaction times and ERP amplitudes between conditions.

## Results and Findings

- No significant differences were found in reaction times or ERP amplitudes (N400 and P600) between conditions.
- The small sample size (N=1) and potential experimental design flaws likely contributed to the lack of significant results.
